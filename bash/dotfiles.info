~/.bash_profile: simply load .profile followed by .bashrc (rc if interactive)
~/.profile: use for non bash-specific: env vars / PATH
~/.bashrc: interactives e.g. prompt, EDITOR, aliases

- anything needed by graphical applications OR sh (or bash invoked as sh) MUST be in ~/.profile
- anything that should be available to login shells should go in ~/.profile
- do not output from ~/.bashrc
- remove ~/.bash_login
